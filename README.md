# BadBank

## Description
  This projects is a stand alone website that replicates a banking website. It's called bad bank because their is no security and all the data can be accessed. 
 
## How to run 
  To run this project you will need to clone these files to your local machine. Then in the folder you will need to make sure you have npm installed and then run npx http-server which will launch a local sever that you will display the site. 
  
## Roadmap of future improvements
  Down the road I would like to get this reconfigured into a React app so that I can start implementing testing functionality a little more easily and get more familiar with what needs to be imnported and where to keep the code functioning. I would also like to add a form component similar to the context page where we laid out the card component so that you can easily change/update forms as needed and add more in the future.
